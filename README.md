Finding an available parking spot in a congested parking lot can be a daunting and
time-consuming task, leading to frustration, traffic congestion, and increased environmental pollution. 
This problem is exacerbated in urban areas, where parking
spaces are in high demand, and traditional methods of parking spot detection fall
short in providing efficient solutions. 

To address this issue, we propose the development of a mobile application that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Image
Processing technologies to assist users in locating vacant parking slots within a
specific area.Our Keen City Vehicle Positioning Inhabitance Tracking And Managing System 
aims to revolutionize the parking experience by providing real-time
information about available parking spaces. Through the use of cameras and image
processing algorithms, the system continuously monitors the parking lot, identifying occupied and vacant spots. 

The mobile web app, linked to this system, allows users
to access up-to-date parking availability information, saving time and reducing the
stress associated with parking.In addition to its immediate benefits, the System
holds significant promise for the future. As it gains popularity and more parking
lots integrate its technology, the system can contribute to a reduction in urban
traffic congestion and lower carbon emissions.
